# PromptSecondaryLTUnb/python

This is the directory for all the python scripts, see the README files in the
relevant subdirectories for more details.

C++ scripts live in the scripts directory.

Data is read from the ../data directory

Scripts in this directory are : 

commonoptions.py          : holds common options for all options parsers for other scripts

pruneTuple_SepSSFromOS.py : prunes the larger tuple in the "data" directory into two smaller "signal"
                            and "background" tuples which can be used to train the classifiers, whether
                            TMVA or scikit-learn or whatever, to separate tracks associated with the
                            same side of the decay, and tracks associated with the other side of the decay.
